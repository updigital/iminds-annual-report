        <h2>Digital challenges and opportunities in media</h2>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The media sector—both in Flanders and worldwide—faces major challenges. The continuing economic crisis has caused a significant drop in revenue from advertising. Digital (r)evolutions put the classic business model of media companies under enormous pressure. Consumers no longer exclusively view media content on their television screens or in newspapers and magazines, as they did in the past. Media content is increasingly consumed online, via PCs, smartphones or tablets. Moreover, consumers now have the power to determine when, where and how they view that content. They are also increasingly involved—via social media—in the distribution and creation of content, traditionally the exclusive domain of major broadcasters and publishers.</p>

     <p><strong>Art and technology
     </strong></p>
     <p>The iMinds Art&D program promotes cross-fertilization between art and technology. Specifically, the program provides funding for a number of art and design projects with a significant technological component. Projects should be innovative, offer creative potential and explicitly encourage interaction between artists, designers and researchers. Five projects were launched in 2012 within the theme “Augmented Cities.”

     <p><strong>Preserving and opening up our audiovisual heritage 
     </strong></p>
     <p>iMinds has conducted several research projects in the past dealing directly with the digital preservation of our cultural heritage. The Flemish government made funds available in 2012 for the creation of VIAA—the Flemish Institute for the Digital Archiving and opening up of Audiovisual heritage. The institute will combine the various initiatives in this field and aims to create economies of scale. Responsibility for the start-up of the initiative was assigned to iMinds. VIAA not only focuses on traditional media companies such as broadcasters, but also on cultural organizations or businesses and governments that want to digitize their archives.

     <p><strong>Increasing media awareness 
     </strong></p>
     <p>In 2012, the Flemish government assigned the task of establishing a Media Literacy knowledge center to iMinds. The aim is to increase awareness of (new) media and provide consumers with insight into their operation. Special attention is given to specific target groups such as children, the elderly and the poor. Major topics include privacy, security, advertising, games and the digital divide.
